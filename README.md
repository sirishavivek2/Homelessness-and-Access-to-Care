Describe the project theme.
We will be reviewing the concerning intersection between homelessness and access to healthcare
in Los Angeles County. We believe that the survey responses will indicate that a significant
portion of the population lacks adequate access to essential healthcare services, including dental,
vision, and mental health care. The uninsured rate among adults aged 18-64 remains a persistent
challenge, with disparities observed across different demographics. We believe these gaps in
coverage and care contribute to a cycle where individuals experiencing homelessness face
greater health risks but have limited means to address them. Additionally, our hypothesis is that
client satisfaction and assessment surveys will reveal that many individuals seek more
information and services related to nutrition, fitness, and substance abuse recovery, possibly
indicating an unmet need for comprehensive support systems.
Furthermore, the increasing difficulty in securing stable healthcare coverage exacerbates the
vulnerabilities faced by those on the brink of or already experiencing homelessness. We will
show with the data from the Los Angeles County Health Survey that disparities in healthcare
access are largely driven by socioeconomic inequities, which disproportionately affect lowerincome and marginalized communities. Without targeted interventions to expand healthcare
access—such as increased coverage options, outreach efforts, and affordable healthcare
solutions—homeless individuals will continue to struggle with both immediate and long-term
health concerns. Addressing this issue requires a multi-faceted approach that integrates housing
stability with accessible, community-based healthcare services to break the cycle of
homelessness and improve overall public health outcomes.
